                <h1><b> STEPS TO FOLLOW:</b></h1>
                <pre>
                   
Boil the hakka noodles according to package directions. Be sure to rinse noodles under cold water after they are done cooking. To keep noodles from sticking to one another  drizzle 1-2 tbsp of oil, and use your hands to gently separate the noodles from one another. Set Aside.
Heat a large wok or wide bottom pot to medium high heat and add 2 tbsp oil.
Once the oil is hot, add the green chilis and let them splutter for a few seconds and then add the white and pale green parts of the scallion. Cook for about 1-2 minutes and next, add the sliced bell peppers. Cook the peppers until they just barely begin to soften.
Next, add the ginger, garlic  stir until the raw smell of garlic has disappeared, but garlic has not browned.
Once the garlic and ginger are fragrant, add the cabbage, carrots, and salt. Stir for about a minute.
Reduce the heat to low and toss the noodles into your pot. On top of the noodles add soy sauce, chili sauce, vinegar, and white pepper. Use tongs or two mixing spoons to toss everything together very well. If necessary- use scissors to cut the noodles.
Lastly, garnish the noodles with the remaining green parts of the scallions, give the noodles a quick toss and serve hot! Taste for salt and adust as needed.
Additionally, a drizzle of chili oil, or crushed red chili flakes can be added for more spice!
